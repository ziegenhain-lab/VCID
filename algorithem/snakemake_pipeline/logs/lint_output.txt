    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In
      distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover.
      In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become

    * Param output_dir is a prefix of input or output file but hardcoded:
      If this is meant to represent a file path prefix, it will fail when
      running workflow in environments without a shared filesystem. Instead,
      provide a function that infers the appropriate prefix from the input or
      output file, e.g.: lambda w, input: os.path.splitext(input[0])[0]
